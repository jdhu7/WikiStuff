++ Cethulic

Cethulic, Wary and Knowledgable, is the Being of watching. Races of Cethulic include halfings, fetchlings, and kobolds. These races are generally capable of watching others unnoticeable, and are always cautious about befriending others. Back before free will, Cethulic was one to never trust the other Beings. She noticed how the others would betray each other and the self inflicted pain it would eventually cause. She became a master of patience, able to forego immediate reward for a long term benefit. Do not betray a Cethulian, for they will know everything about your life, find the best time to strike, and do so. There is no surprising one of them, as they were prepared and saw it coming a mile away.
