Erglor - Human colony in unchartered territory

This human settlement is largely unknown. No one knows the exact location. Walk into a bar and bring up this town and you'll get five different stories that contradict each other.
Every body knows someone who was involved with this town. It exists on the north east of the eastern penninsula of Ogtar, a place largely left to destructive tribes and hostile wildlife.
The last known contact the main kingdom has received about Erglor is a threat of an impending bugbear attack.
