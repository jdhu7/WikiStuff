Magukan - Dwarven Farming outpost on the west coast of the dwarven isles.

Magukan was a small farming outpost on the edge of the dwarven isles that was founded around 1120. It existed until the year of destruction in 1162 where it was the first town to fall.
The dwarves utilized it as a supplier for the great dwarven mining town of Kapochun in the center of the dwarven isles. Elvish settlers coexisted, as they provided the farming tools and knowledge needed.
The dwarves provided security and any metals needed. The mayors of Magukan said that the town was engulfed in flames one day from a forest fire that came from the southern coast, but do not remember much else. The outpost was never rebuilt
after the fire and was overtaken by the forest shortly after.
