Sheridan - The holy knight of Lowpchesk.

A brave and valiant soldier that gave up his life to channel Lowpchesk's might into the necromancer that haunted the dwarven isles in 1162. He is remembered
in a constellation that shines brightly during the month of Slowvec, in which all charms of Lowpchesk are slightly stronger.
