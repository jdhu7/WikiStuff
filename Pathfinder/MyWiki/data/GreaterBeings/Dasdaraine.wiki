++ Dasdaraine

Dasdaraine embraced the plants that Sunetlo created and dedicated her races to them. Elves and merfolk exist to cause growth and harmony in the plane. They exist to see the world grow and continue forward. Dasdaraine also loves restoration and maintenance, as maintenance is a smaller form of growth. Pain is okay for a dasdarin to experience, as when the pain passes, restoration can continue. They have peace with everyone around them, and do not like to cause others pain. They exist in harmony with everyone around them and thus engulf themselves in magic. Wizards and sorcerers normally pledge themselves to Dasdaraine in hopes that their magic will bolster. Dasdarin societies are found in advanced cave structures, as none will dare cut down trees to build.
