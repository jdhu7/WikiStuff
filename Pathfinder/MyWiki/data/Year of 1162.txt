Year of 1162 - Great Destruction

The year of 1162 was the year in which the dwarven isles were under siege from a necromantic force. Death was all too common during this year, with at least two towns lost. Magukan and Kapochun 
both fell victim to the necromancer. Kapochun was forced to be abandoned after a large city fire left an ample amount of corpses to be reanimated. All except two city guards perished while the citizens escaped.
The necromancer was only defeated until a Lowpcheskian cleric and his adventuring party used subterfuge and betrayal to sneak into the necromancer's headquarters and defeat him while bestowed with the might of Lowpchesk.
Dwarven society was set back many years by this invasion, with Kapochun still in ruins. The dwarven people are few and small between on the isles, mainly 
residing in the capital city as there are not enough resources to maintain the rest.
