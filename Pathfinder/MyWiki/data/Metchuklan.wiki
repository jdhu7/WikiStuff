++ Metchuklan

The one who destroys is a vile Being. He spends his time finding ways to destroy whatever is nearby. Death follows him. Metchuklan spends no time planning for maximum destruction, that is vital time that takes away from smashing. His races include the orcs and goblins, two races content to smash whatever they can find. Nothing else matters to them, which leaves their society and culture very underdeveloped compared to the other races. They live in tribes that roam the world, searching for things to destroy. Nothing else matters to a Metchick, only those whose destructivity is valued more than their destruction can remain alive.
