++ Houkisar

Houkisar has no concerns for the safety of anyone around them. It only cares that the cause and effect were written down and recorded. For it is the patron of medicine and plague, the GreaterBeing of science. It puts together chemicals, and releases them on the world. The effects are written down, the chemical's original recipe stored away, and the research progresses forward. The races of Houkisar include gnomes and hobgoblins, tinkerers and alchemists. Those who pledge themselves to Houkisar must be unattatched to life around them. Nothing can stand in the way of a Houkisan, for science dedicates their life. Houkisar settlements are organized villages where everyone and everything has a purpose. Occasionally an individual lives a hermit life in a dedication for science.
