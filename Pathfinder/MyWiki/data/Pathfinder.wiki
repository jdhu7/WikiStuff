    The world of [UnumKosmos] is the creation of all the [GreaterBeings] as a form of entertainment and demonstration of epic power. The [GreaterBeings] decided that the world would be a great place to settle differences and arguments, since conflict in their world was outlawed. Each Being was allowed to create one race at the creation of the world, with more added as the balance shifted too drasticly to one side. The Beings formed alliances with one another, lied, betrayed, and fought on the battlefield which was UnumKosmos. [Races] were merely pawns to win the game, individuals hardly mattered. The games were never too serious; wars, disease and famine never claimed too many lives and recoverly was inevitable. [Sunetlo], who was the founder of [UnumKosmos], never joined in the games of the other gods, content to sit and watch his race grow and learn. Destruction caught up to him, and soon he became the target of the others. His race perished and their legacy faded. [Sunetlo] could not bear to sit and watch another race see the same fate. His desire to watch things grow and learn eventually overcame him, and he researched a way to stay involved. He became the worldbearer, the one who watches over the natural forces of the world. He created the fauna and life that thrive all over the planets. Each Being was given a [Region] to claim as their own, where their races could reside. [Sunetlo] also bestowed a neutral force of magic unto the world, as a way for individuals to mimic the powers of the Beings. This magic, when a person is truely connected to the soul of the world, allows an individual to transcend the command of their Being. It greates a sense of free will, and those with a strong inclination become adventures. [Sunetlo] realized that free will is a blessing and a curse, as though it allowed some to escape hateful destructive ways to pursue growth, it also allowed evil far greater than capable by the Beings alone. With only his limited interaction through the soul of the world, the other Beings shape and meld their races with a manipulation of free will. Will adventurers escape the curse of their race or is the cosmic propaganda the path to salvation?
