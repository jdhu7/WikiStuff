++ Sunetlo

Sunetlo, the soul of the world, is the binding force that drives the individuals on [//UnumKosmos]. He is the creator of free will and nature and the promoter of individualism. He is the reason why disobeying the Beings is possible. He does not care for anything but self growth. Magic and nature are equally usable by both good and evil, and takes them to their full potential. Adventurers follow Sunetlo alongside their original Being, for they thank him for the opportunity. In most individuals' final moments, this praising and thanking turns to cursing. If only those who perished didn't follow their internal call to explore the world. To Sunetlo, they died with a full heart and grew the strength of magic. Those who kill, do so because they want to, not because of their race. With no race to call his own, he claims animated objects as his own, for they truly exist without external influence. Those who follow Sunetlo follow their inner souls.
