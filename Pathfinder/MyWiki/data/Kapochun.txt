Kapochun - Great mining city

Kapochun existed as the central mining hub for all dwarven society. It was integral part of the dwarven economy, and was fueled by many smaller outposts that would gather the much needed mining supplies.
The town worshipped Lowpchesk and even started a wandering brotherhood before the destruction hit the city. A necromancer was able to feed off the negative energy that an underground dwarven fight club provided
to resurrect the recent deaths of a house fire. The city was abandoned and remains so. No dwarves dare to attemp to reclaim the city.
